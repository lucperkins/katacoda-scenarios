With our agents already configured to send data to our Aggregator, we need to
configure the Aggregator to use those agents as sources. We can start with our
Vector Agent:

<pre class="file" data-filename="first-pipeline/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-vector-agent-source">[sources.vector_agents]
type = "vector"
address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
version = "2"
'''</pre>

With this config, the Aggregator listens on port 9000 for incoming events sent by any Vector Agents.

Now let's add our Datadog Agent:

<pre class="file" data-filename="first-pipeline/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-datadog-agent-source">[sources.datadog_agents]
type = "datadog_agent"
address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
store_api_key = false
'''</pre>

Here we listen for events from any Datadog Agents on port 8080.
