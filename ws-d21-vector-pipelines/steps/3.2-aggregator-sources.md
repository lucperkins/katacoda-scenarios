With our agents already configured to send data to our Aggregator, we need to configure the Aggregator to use those
agents as sources. Let's start with our Vector Agents:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-vector-agent-source">[sources.vector_agents]
type = "vector"
address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
version = "2"</pre>

Now let's add our Datadog Agent:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-datadog-agent-source">[sources.datadog_agents]
type = "datadog_agent"
address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
store_api_key = false</pre>

And finally, let's configure our Aggregator to take in metrics from a server that's emitting [Prometheus] metrics

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-prometheus-source">[sources.prometheus_node_exporter]
type = "prometheus_scrape"
address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
store_api_key = false</pre>

Now our Aggregator is ready to take in both logs and metrics from a variety of sources.
