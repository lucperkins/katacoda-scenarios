With our agents already configured to send data to our Aggregator, we need to
configure the Aggregator to use those agents as sources. We can start with our
Vector Agent:

<pre class="file" data-filename="first-pipeline/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-vector-agents">[sources.vector_agents]
type = "vector"
address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
version = "2"
'''</pre>
