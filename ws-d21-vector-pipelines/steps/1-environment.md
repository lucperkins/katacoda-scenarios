Our workshop environment has two core elements:

- The `Terminal` window is a Linux terminal environment where we'll work with a
  pre-installed Vector executable and some other tools. You can run terminal
  commands by clicking on them. Try it with `whoami`{{execute}}.
- The `IDE` window is an in-browser version of [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
  where we'll view and edit configuration and other files.

First, let's explore our terminal by making sure that Vector is installed in our
environment:

```
vector --version
```{{execute}}

If you *don't* see version information pop up, please do notify a TA in the chat
and they'll help you out ASAP.
