In this scenario, we'll have multiple observability agents sending data to our
Vector Aggregator:

* Vector Agents forwarding IoT device logs
* [Datadog Agents][datadog] forwarding logs describing some user transactions

We'll see the structure of these logs in a little bit. Just as a reminder,
here's a basic illustration of what we're working with:

```
                     +------------+
(Vector Agents)  --> |   Vector   |
                     |            | --> (Sinks)
(Datadog Agents) --> | Aggregator |
                     +------------+
```

We won't actually *configure* the Agents here. Instead, our scenario will assume
that they're already running and sending data.
