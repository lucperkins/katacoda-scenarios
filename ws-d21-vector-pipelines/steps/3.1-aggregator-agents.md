In this scenario, we'll have multiple observability agents that send data to our
Vector Aggregator:

* Two Vector Agents forwarding HTTP server logs
* [Datadog Agents][datadog] collecting HTTP server logs

These agents will all be sending logs. Our Aggregator will also be handling metrics emitted by
[Prometheus][prometheus] [Node Exporters][node_exporter].

Here's a diagram of what that looks like:
