In this scenario, we'll have multiple observability agents that send data to our
Vector Aggregator:

* Vector Agents forwarding IoT device logs
* [Datadog Agents][datadog] forwarding logs describing some user transactions

These agents will be sending **logs**. We'll see the structure of these logs in
a little bit.

Our Aggregator will also be handling **metrics** in [Prometheus][prometheus]
formatted emitted by some [Node Exporters][node_exporter] providing hardware and
system information.

Here's a diagram of what our full scenario will look like:
