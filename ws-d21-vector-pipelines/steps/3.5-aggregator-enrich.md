The IoT device logs that the Aggregator is receiving from the Vector Agents have this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "<integer>",
  "time": "<unix timestamp>",
  "device_id": "<string>"
}
```

Here's an example log:

```json
{
  "code": 3,
  "time": 1259664634,
  "device_id": "device1"
}
```

There are 5 possible `code`s: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 1 means that the battery is full, 5 means
that the battery is critically low, and so on.

Because these logs are coming from IoT devices, we want to keep the payloads coming from the devices
small. But we want to enrich each event with some information in the Aggregator:

1. We want to add a text description to replace the `code` so the logs are more human readable
2. We want to reformat the timestamp to be human readable

For #1, we're going to use a [CSV] file to map human-readable messages to codes:

```csv
code,message
1,"device battery full"
2,"device battery good"
3,"device battery ok"
4,"device battery low"
5,"device battery critical"
```

> You can see that file in your IDE at `aggregator/vector/aggregator/codes.csv`{{open}}.

For #2, we'll use VRL to format the timestamp into [RFC 3339][rfc_3339], like this:

```
2001-07-08T00:34:60.026490+09:30
```

## Enrichment table configuration

In order to use the `codes.csv` file, we need to update our Vector configuration to recognize it:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-enrichment-tables-config">[enrichment_tables.codes]
type = "file"

[enrichment_tables.codes.file]
path = "/etc/vector/aggregator/vector/aggregator/codes.csv"
encoding = { type = "csv" }

[enrichment_tables.codes.schema]
code = "integer"
message = "string"</pre>

Now that we've configured an enrichment table, we can use VRL to translate `code`s into messages like `"device battery
ok"`:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-enrichment-transform">[transforms.enrich_iot_logs]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["vector_agents"]
source = '''
. = parse_json!(.message)

row, err = get_enrichment_table_record("codes", { "code": del(.code) })
if err != null {
  log(err, level: "error")
} else {
  .status = row.message
}
'''</pre>

Save those changes and run `vector tap enrich_iot_logs`{{execute}} to see the output from this transform.

## Formatting the timestamp

The second change we want to make is to reformat the timestamp. This bit of VRL will accomplish that for us:

```
ts = to_timestamp!(.time)
.time = format_timestamp!(ts, "%+")
```{{copy}}

Click the text area above to copy the code and we'll paste it into our `enrich` transform in
`aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml`{{open}}.

## Viewing the output

Let's have a look at the output using `vector tap`:

```
vector tap enrich_iot_logs
```{{execute}}
