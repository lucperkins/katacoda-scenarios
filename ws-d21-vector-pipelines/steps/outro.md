And that's a wrap! Thank you so much for taking part in Highly Scalable Observability Pipelines with Vector. I think we
accomplished a great deal today. We learned the basics of configuring Vector pipelines, we got a taste of Vector Remap
Language, we eavesdropped on Vector using `vector tap`, and more. As always, there were
some things we had to brush over or skip entirely, but I hope that you come away from this with a solid initial toolkit
that you can use to begin building your own highly scalable observability data pipelines using Vector.
