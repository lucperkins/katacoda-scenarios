Thus far we've only worked with logs in our Aggregator. Let's take a quick second to work with
metrics. In an earlier step, we created a source called `prometheus_node_exporter` that scrapes
Prometheus metrics from a service that exports them.

Let's modify those metrics by adding some metadata tags to each metric:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-metrics-transform">[transforms.tag_metrics]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["prometheus_node_exporter"]
source = '''
.tags = {
  "aggregator": "prod-aggregator-1",
  "region": "us-west-1"
}
'''</pre>

Let's restart our Aggregator using `make restart-aggregator`{{execute}} and
use `vector tap tag_metrics`{{execute}}.
