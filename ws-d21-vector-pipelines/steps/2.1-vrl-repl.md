Vector offers a REPL that you can use to experiment with VRL. We can open that
up using the Vector CLI's [`vrl`][vrl_cmd] command:

`vector vrl --input /etc/vector/vrl/event.json`{{execute interrupt}}

Some helpers while we're in the REPL:

* `help`{{execute}} for a help menu
* `help functions`{{execute}} to list available VRL functions
* `next`{{execute}} and `prev`{{execute}} to navigate between example events
