Vector offers a Read-eval-print loop (REPL) that we can use to experiment with VRL. Let's open that
up using the Vector CLI's [`vrl`][vrl_cmd] command:

```
vector vrl \
  --input /etc/vector/vrl/event.json
```{{execute interrupt}}

You should see a standard CLI with a `$` prompt. With the command above we loaded the REPL with an
example log event. Run `.`{{execute}} to see that event, which should look like this:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/users",
  "status": 200
}
```

This is a very simply log event from an HTTP server. We'll modify the event in the next section.
