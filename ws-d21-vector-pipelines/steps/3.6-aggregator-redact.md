The Datadog Agents in our pipeline are forwarding transaction logs to our Aggregator. Those logs
have this structure:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "type": "<transaction type>",
    "credit_card": {
      "type": "<card type>",
      "number": "<credit card number>"
    }
  },
  "email": "<user email>",
  "timestamp": "<now>"
}
```

The problem with these logs is that they contain information that we do *not* want to store in our
observability database. Information like credit card numbers and email addresses can be useful in
*some* scenarios, of course, but in observability contexts it's often better to make sure that
Personal Identifying Information (PII) is removed as early in the data pipeline as possible. So
let's configure our Aggregator to **redact** sensitive information.

VRL has a [`redact`][redact] function that we can use for that. This function enables us to
supply patterns to look for in the values of our event and if the patterns match the value, the
value is replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-redaction-transform">[transforms.redact]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["datadog_agents"]
source = '''
. = redact(., filters: [
  r'^\d{16}$',
  r'^(\w+)@(\w+).(\w+)$'
])
'''</pre>

Here, our `redact` transform listens for events coming from our Datadog Agents and runs the `redact` function on the
whole event. There are two filters at work:

* A regex for email addresses: `r'^(\w+)@(\w+).(\w+)$'`
* A regex for credit card numbers: r'^\d{16}$'

Please note that these regular expressions are for demo purposes. Redaction in production typically requires more robust
regular expressions.
