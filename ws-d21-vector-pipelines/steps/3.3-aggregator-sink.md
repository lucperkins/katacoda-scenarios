For the time being, we're going to use a special Vector sink called [`blackhole`][blackhole] for
all of our sources. This sink sends events... actually nowhere. But it's useful because it ensures
that we have a valid pipeline in place for testing things locally. Let's add that sink to our
Aggregator config:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-blackhole-sink">[sinks.disappear]
type = "blackhole"
inputs = ["*"]
'''</pre>

Later on we'll configure our Aggregator to send data to multiple sinks.
