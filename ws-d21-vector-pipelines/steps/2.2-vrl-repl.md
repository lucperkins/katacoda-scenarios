First, let's experiment with VRL in its REPL. We can open that up using the Vector CLI's
[`vrl`][vrl_cmd] command with no arguments:

`vector vrl`{{execute interrupt}}

Some helpers while we're in the REPL:

* `help`{{execute}} for a help menu
* `help functions`{{execute}} to list available VRL functions
* `next`{{execute}} and `prev`{{execute}} to navigate between events
