Once we've gotten a taste of the language in the REPL, let's work with a set of real observability
events:

```
vector vrl --input /etc/vector/vrl/events.jsonl
```{{execute interrupt}}

A summary of the events:

* A Syslog event
* An Apache Common event
* A metric event

Once we're done with that, we can quit the REPL by running `exit`{{execute}}.
