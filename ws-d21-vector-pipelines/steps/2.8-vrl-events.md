Once we've gotten a taste of the language in the REPL, let's work with some real observability events:

```
vector vrl --input /etc/vector/vrl/events.jsonl
```{{execute interrupt}}

A summary of the events:

* A Syslog event
* A JSON event (as an encoded JSON string)
* An Apache Common event
* A metric event
