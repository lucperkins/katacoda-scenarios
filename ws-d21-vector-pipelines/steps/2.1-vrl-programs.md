As we saw in the last section, VRL **programs** are run by Vector inside of transforms. Programs
take in one single observability event at a time, do something with it, and then output the
resulting event to the next component (maybe a sink, maybe another transform). Here's a full example
program to run in our REPL:

```
. = { "method": "POST", "status": 200, "path": "/users" }s
.method = downcase(.method)
.timestamp = now()
.success = del(.status) == 200
```{{execute}}
