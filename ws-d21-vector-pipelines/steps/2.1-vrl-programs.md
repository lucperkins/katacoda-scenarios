As we saw in the last section, VRL **programs** are run by Vector inside of transforms. Programs
take in one single observability event at a time, do something with it, and then output the
resulting event to the next component (maybe a sink, maybe another transform). Here's a full example
program to run in our REPL:

```
. = { "method": "POST", "status": 200, "path": "/users" }
.method = downcase(.method)
.timestamp = now()
```{{execute}}

Here, we set the value of the event to an object, then downcased the value of `method` and added a
`timestamp` field. VRL has a simple execution model: whatever the state of the event (the `.`) is
at the end of the program is its final state; it then goes on to the next stage in the pipeline.
