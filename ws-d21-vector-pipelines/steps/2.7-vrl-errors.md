Reliability in production environments is one of the core goals of Vector, and thus **error
handling** is an extremely important concept in VRL. Some Vector functions are **infallible**, which
means that they can't fail. Two examples:

```
.id = uuid_v4()
.timestamp = now()
```{{execute}}

But many functions are **fallible**, which means that they do throw potential errors. **All errors
in VRL must be handled** or else your VRL programs don't compile. There are three ways to handle
errors in VRL functions.

## Assignment

```
parsed_json, err = 
```{{execute}}
