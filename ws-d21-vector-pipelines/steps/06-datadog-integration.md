Note to dry run attendees:

I was hoping to have a lovely demo of sending events to Datadog using Vector ready to go for today, but I overestimated
my knowledge of the Datadog product. Between now and November 1st I'll put together a compelling dashboard that shows
just how compelling our future Datadog/Vector integration will be.
