VRL **programs** are run by Vector inside of transforms. Programs take in one single observability
event at a time, do something with it, and then output the resulting event to the next step in the
pipeline. Here's a full example program to run in our REPL:

```
.method = downcase!(.method)
.timestamp = now()
```{{execute}}

Here, we downcase the value of `method` and add a `timestamp` field.

VRL has a simple execution model: whatever the state of the event (the `.`) is at the end of the
program is its final state; it then goes on to the next stage in the pipeline.

Run `.`{{execute}} to see the resulting event. As we can see, we've changed the content of the event
using our VRL program. If we put this program in a `remap` transform, then this changed log event
would be passed on to the next step in the pipeline. Here's what that would look like in a Vector
configuration:

```toml
[transforms.modify_http_logs]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["http_logs"]
source = '''
.method = downcase!(.method)
.timestamp = now()
'''
```
