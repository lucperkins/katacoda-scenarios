At this point we have sources and a sinkâ€”enough to have a valid pipeline that we can iterate on.
Let's start up our Aggregator.

```
cd /etc/vector/aggregator
make run-aggregator-scenario
```{{execute interrupt}}

This should take 20-30 seconds to start up. Run `make check`{{execute}} periodically and wait until
all of the containers have the status `Up`. Once that happens, our whole scenario is running
smoothly in the background.

## Monitoring Vector itself

With our Aggregator scenario running in the background, let's take a quick look at a tool that
often comes in handy when running Vector in real environments.

### vector tap

[`vector tap`][tap] enables you to "eavesdrop" on log events as they flow through a Vector
pipeline. Let's start it up:

```
vector tap
```{{execute}}

When run with no arguments, `vector tap` eavesdrops on *everything*, displaying all the logs flowing
through your Vector pipeline. But that's often a bit imprecise; it's usually more useful to target
a specific component. Let's try that with the `vector_agents` source:

```
vector tap vector_agents
```{{execute interrupt}}

And again with the `datadog_agents` source:

```
vector tap datadog_agents
```{{execute}}

Now we have a way to see what's going on in our Aggregator from afar, while it's
running.
