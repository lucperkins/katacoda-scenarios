Now that we've learned a bit about [Vector] and observability data pipelines, we can kick off the
more hands-on portion of the workshop.

Our workshop environment has a few core elements:

* A Linux terminal environment where we'll work with a pre-installed Vector executable
* An in-browser version of [Visual Studio Code][vscode] where we'll view and edit configuration and
  other files.

First, let's have a look at our terminal by making sure that Vector is installed in our environment:

```
vector --version
```{{execute}}

If you *don't* see version information pop up, please do notify a TA in the chat and they'll help
you out ASAP.
