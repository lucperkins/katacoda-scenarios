When using Vector in production environments, it's often important to be able to monitor Vector
itself. To that end, Vector enables you to use its own logs and metrics as observability data sources.
We won't actually *send* Vector's internal logs and metrics anywhere in this workshop, but we could do
so using a configuration like this:

<pre class="file" data-filename="aggregator/vector/aggregator/vector.toml" data-target="insert" data-marker="#insert-vector-internal">[sources.vector_aggregator_logs]
type = "internal_logs"

[sources.vector_aggregator_metrics]
type = "internal_metrics"

[sinks.vector_logs_to_dd]
type = "datadog_logs"
inputs = ["vector_aggregator_logs"]
default_api_key = "${DD_API_KEY}"

[sinks.vector_metrics_to_dd]
type = "datadog_metrics"
inputs = ["vector_aggregator_metrics"]
api_key = "${DD_API_KEY}"</pre>

As with any Vector sources, we could also transform this data if we wanted to and send it off to
any sinks that we choose. We won't do that today, but it's good to know that this powerful insight
lever into Vector itself can be configured into your Aggregator.
