In VRL, the dot (`.`) represents the event object.

You can assign values to a path using `=`:

* `.status = 200`{{execute}}
* `.transaction.outcome = "success"`{{execute}} (nested)

Paths support quoted field names:

`.errors."uh oh" = "system failure"`{{execute}}

VRL uses standard array syntax:

`.fruits[0] = "kiwi"`{{execute}}
