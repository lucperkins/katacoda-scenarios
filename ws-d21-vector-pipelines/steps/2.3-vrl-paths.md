Let's dig into the language syntax a bit. In VRL, the dot (`.`) represents the event object.

You can assign new values, or change existing values, using `=`:

* `.status = 400`{{execute}}
* `.message = "failure"`{{execute}}
* `.transaction.outcome = "success"`{{execute}} (nested)

You can delete the value at a path using the `del` function:

```
.delete_me = "please"
del(.delete_me)
```{{execute}}

And you can check whether a value exists at a path using the `exists` function:

`exists(.very.deeply.nested.value)`{{execute}}

Compare with:

```
.very.deeply.nested.value = "exists now!"
exists(.very.deeply.nested.value)
```{{execute}}
