In VRL, the dot (`.`) represents the event object.

You can assign values to a path using `=`:

* `.status = 200`{{execute}}
* `.message = "failure"`{{execute}}
* `.transaction.outcome = "success"`{{execute}} (nested)

Paths support quoted field names:

`.errors."uh oh" = "system failure"`{{execute}}

VRL uses standard array syntax:

`.fruits[0] = "kiwi"`{{execute}}

VRL can even backfill arrays:

`.cars[2] = "Karmann Ghia"`

You can delete the value at a path using the `del` function:

```
.delete_me = "please"
del(.delete_me)
```{{execute}}

And you can check whether a value exists at a path using the `exists` function:

`exists(.very.deeply.nested.value)`

Compare with:

```
.very.deeply.nested.value = "exists now!"
exists(.very.deeply.nested.value)
```{{execute}}
